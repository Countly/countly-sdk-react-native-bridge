# Creating the Sample Countly RN App

To run a React Native application you have to set up your environment correctly.
Please refer to the React Native [documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment)* to check the latest information on this topic.

(Incase  there is a change in documentation links you should check the React Native [offical site](https://reactnative.dev/))

## Automatic App Creation

If you have setted up your environment correctly then you should be able to run the example app by running the create_app.py provided

```bash
python create_app.py
```

Then you can start the app by:

```bash
npx react-native run-android 
# or npx react-native run-ios
```

## Manual App Creation
For more information you can check [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started-without-a-framework).

If you want to set up the app manually instead, then you should run:

```bash
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init AwesomeProject --version 0.74.0
#Â Version here may vary but make sure to use a stabile version of the react-native
# Latest versions can experience issues because of unstability
```

Then copy the contents of CountlyRNExample into the AwesomeProject and let it replace the App.tsx there.

Then add "countly-sdk-react-native-bridge" into dependencies in package.json:

```bash
npm install --save countly-sdk-react-native-bridge@latest
# if you are on iOS then you should also:
# cd ios
# pod install
```

Finally you can run:

```bash
npx react-native run-android 
# or npx react-native run-ios
```
## Debugging  
For possible java issues you can try some of the following options:
- changing the IDE settings.
- changing the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
- changing `org.gradle.java.home` in `gradle.properties`.

Currently Java 17 and bigger is needed.

For a ninja issue about path length you might want to download and point to a specific ninja version:
```java
// under app level build.gradle's defaultConfig
  externalNativeBuild {
      cmake {
          arguments "-DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=your_path\ninja.exe", "-DCMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX=1024"
      }
  }
```

For an issue with the recent version of React Native (0.76) about safe area context you can check this [thread](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context/issues/539#issuecomment-2436529368).
